# Searching

This project involves using depth-first and breadth-first searching algorithms.

## Anagrams.py
The program takes a .txt file with a list of words and finds all anagrams present.

## Word_Ladders.py
This program generates a list of words that will connect the start word with the end word. Each word in the list differs by one letter from its neighbors.  
Example:
```
['planes', 'flanes', 'flakes', 'slakes', 'snakes']
````
## Boggle.py
This program identifies all possible words in a 4x4 grid using a stack algorithm with a dictionary.
